# Exercise 005 - Create a custom image

1) Create an empty directory in which you will store your Dockerfile;

2) Compose a Dockerfile so that:
   - Starts FROM ubuntu:latest;
   - Use these three environmental variables:
      NCAT_MESSAGE = "Container test";
      NCAT_HEADER "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
      NCAT_PORT "8888";
   - While building installs the nmap package;
   - While executing launches an ncat command that expose the NCAT_PORT and
     print via NCAT_HEADER the NCAT_MESSAGE;

3) Build the container image;

4) Run the newly created container image to check that it deploys correctly;
