# Exercise 000 - Using registry.py to interact with repos

1) Download from the GitHub repo [1] the python script registry.py and make it
   executable;

2) Satisfy python dependencies with pip (if any, i.e. www_authenticate);

3) Query a public repo for the nginx images (i.e. MMUL repository is accessbile
   pointing to www.mmul.it via https on port 5000 with user 'dockertraining' and
   password 'l3tstr41n');
