# Exercise 008 - Configure your container to write on a syslog server

1) Create this path of directory in your working dir:

rsyslog/
\ config
\ logs

2) Create a config file for rsyslog that will accept connections from the TCP
   514 port and will store all the logs marked as facility local6 into the
   /logs/docker/docker.log file;

3) Using the rsyslog/syslog_appliance_alpine image [1], start a new container
   named "rsyslog" that will bind mount the rsyslog/logs local dir into
   container dir /logs and rsyslog/config local dir into container dir /config.
   You will also need to pass the RSYSLOG_CONF environmet variable that will be
   set to /config/rsyslog.conf.
   Finally, you will need to publish the 514 TCP container port to the 5514
   port on your running host;

4) Using the alpine image, run a container that will write logs via syslog
   driver to the newly created rsyslog server, you can make it execute a simple
   command like "ping -c 4 8.8.8.8" and then end.

5) Check the local rsyslog/logs dir to see if new logs were created and contain
   the expected contents;
