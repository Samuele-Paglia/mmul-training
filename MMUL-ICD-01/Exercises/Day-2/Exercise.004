# Exercise 004 - Import an image from a tar file

1) Download and uncompress the tar image named
   Exercise.004.nginx-saved-container.tar.xz that is available on [1];

2) Import the saved image into the docker registry;

3) Run a container starting from this image, exposing port 8080 and note what
   is different from a usual nginx;

4) Download and uncompress now the tar named 
   Exercise.004.nginx-exported-container.tar.xz that is also available on [1];

5) Try to load the image, what happens?

6) Now try to import the image instead, what happens?

7) Finally try to run a container based on this image, is this possible? Can
   you tell why?
