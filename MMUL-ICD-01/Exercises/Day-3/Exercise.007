1) Create the "etc/nginx" and "ssl" directories inside "/tmp/awxcompose";

2) Change the "server" contents of the etc/nginx/nginx.conf to be include the 
   ssl certs;

3) Create the certs associated to the name "awx" that you will use inside
   NGinx;

4) Inside the compose file map the host port 443 to the service port 8052, the
   "/tmp/awxcompose/ssl" host directory to the "/ssl" service directory and the
   "/tmp/awxcompose/etc/nginx/nginx.conf" host file to the
   "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf" service file;

5) Restart the service;
