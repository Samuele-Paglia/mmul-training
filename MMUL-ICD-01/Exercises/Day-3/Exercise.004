# Exercise 004 - Create and run your own compose stack

1) Create and enter a directory named ex004

2) Create a docker-compose.yml file with this specifications:
   - Deploy a container named web based on nginx:alpine which
     map a network named "frontend" and a network named "backend".
	 This container will map a volume named "data" in the path
	 /usr/share/nginx/html
   - Deploy a container named otherweb based on nginx:alpine which
     map a network named "frontend". This container will map a
	 volume named "data" in the path /usr/share/nginx/html
   - Define two default networks, one named "frontend" and one
     named "backend"
   - Define a default volume named "data"

3) Try to execute this compose. What happen?

4) Look inside the running containers to see differences in the
   network

5) Try to exec the command "wget -O- http://localhost" inside the
   two containers

6) Enter one on the container and replace the index.html file in 
   the /usr/share/nginx/html path with "Test compose".

7) Try to exec the command "wget -O- http://localhost" inside the
   two containers. What happen? Why?

8) Try to stop the application stack and look at various docker
   components (volumes, networks, containers)

9) Run again the compose and execute again the wget inside the
   two containers. What happen? Why?
