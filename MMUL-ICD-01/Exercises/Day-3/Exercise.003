# Exercise.003 - Running an existing compose stack

1) Check if docker-compose is installed (otherwise, install it);

2) Create a directory named ex003 and use it as base for the exercise;

3) Get an existing Docker Compose file (i.e. see Exercise.003.compose.yml or
   look at the proposed compose in the Wordpress HUB page [1]) and name it
   docker-compose.yml;

4) Look at the compose file. What does the content will produce?

5) Run the docker-compose command to launch the application stack in foreground
   mode;

6) Try accessing the deployed Wordpress. What happens?

7) After the Wordpress initialization procedure, stop the application stack
   hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal;

8) Delete the containers then run again the application stack in daemon mode;

9) Try accessing the deployed Wordpress. What happens?

10) Stop the running application stack;

11) Look at various Docker components (containers, networks, volumes); Is there
    something strange?
