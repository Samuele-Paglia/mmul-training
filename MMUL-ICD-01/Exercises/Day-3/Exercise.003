# Exercise.003 - Running an existing compose stack

1) Check if docker-compose is installed (otherwise, install it).

2) Create a directory named ex003 and enter it.

3) Get an existing Docker Compose file (i.e. see Exercise.003.compose.yml or
   look at the proposed compose in the Wordpress HUB page [1]) and name it
   docker-compose.yml.

4) Look at the compose file. What are you expecting from that?

5) Run the docker-compose command to launch the application stack in foreground
   mode.

6) Try accessing the deployed Wordpress. What happen?

7) After the Wordpress initialization procedure, stop the application stack
   hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal

8) Delete the containers then run again the application stack in daemon mode.

9) Try accessing the deployed Wordpress. What happen?

10) Stop the running application stack.

11) Look at various Docker components (containers, networks, volumes).
    There are something strange?
