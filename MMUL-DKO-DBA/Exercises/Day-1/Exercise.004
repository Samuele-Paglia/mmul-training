# Exercise 004 - Map a volume for a database

1) Create an empty volume named "test-volume"

2) Check the contents of the newly created volume on the filesystem. Where it
   will be placed?

3) Run a mysql container image named "volume-mapping-test", exposing on
   localhost the 3306 port mapping also the newly created volume into the
   container directory /var/lib/mysql.

4) Check again the status of the volume on the host, what is changed?

5) Using the mysql client from the container, create a new database and a
   new table;

6) Stop the container;

7) Check again the status of the volume on the host;

8) Start a new container with the name "volume-mapping-test-relaunch" and the
   mapping of the previous volume and check that the database adn the table
   are still available despite from the fact that the container was created again
   from scratch;
