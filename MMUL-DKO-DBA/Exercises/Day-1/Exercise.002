# Exercise 002 - Run a database container with environment variables

1) Pull and run the "mysql" container image with the name "environment-var-test"
   passing the environment variable MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD with the value of
   "testr00t";

2) Log into the container and check that the content of the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
   variable is what you set during the launch; log into the database using
   the mysql client inside the container;

3) Exit the shell and enter again the shell, this time overriding the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
   variable with a new value, say "mmul"; check the content of the variable
   and try to log into the database;

4) Exit again the shell and log once again without overriding the variable,
   checking the content of the variable:

5) Was the value changed? What does this mean?
