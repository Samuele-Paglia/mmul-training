# Exercise 006 - Local directory volume mapping

1) Create a directory in your homedir named "test-directory"

2) Run a mysql container image named "directory-mapping-test", exposing on
   localhost the 3306 port mapping also the newly created volume into the
   container directory /var/lib/mysql.

3) Check again the status of the directory on the host, what is changed?

4) Using the mysql client from the container, create a new database and a
   new table;

5) Stop the container;

6) Check again the status of the volume on the host;

7) Start a new container with the name "directory-mapping-test-relaunch" and the
   mapping of the previous volume and check that the database adn the table
   are still available despite from the fact that the container was created again
   from scratch;
