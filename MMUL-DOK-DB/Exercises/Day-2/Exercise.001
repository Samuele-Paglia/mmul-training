# Exercise 001 - Create a custom image

1) Create an empty directory in which you will store your Dockerfile;

2) Compose a Dockerfile so that:
   - Starts FROM mysql:latest;
   - Use these environmental variable to apply a default root password:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = "companyDefaultPassword";

3) Build the container image;

4) Run the newly created container image to check that it deploys correctly;

5) Try to connect to MySQL using the container mysql client and check if
   password is applied;
