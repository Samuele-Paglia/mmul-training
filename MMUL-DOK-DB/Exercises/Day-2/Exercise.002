# Exercise 002 - Create an image from a running container

1) Run a container named "mysql" using the "mysql:latest" image;

2) Log into the container;

3) Change the contents of the my.cnf file to expose mysql on port 1234
   (editor isn't available, you must use the cat > my.cnf <<EOF method);

4) Exit the container console and generate an image starting from this running
   instance, called "my-new-shiny-mysql";

5) Stop the original container;

6) Create a new container starting from the newly created image, and check that
   the modifications made are available;
