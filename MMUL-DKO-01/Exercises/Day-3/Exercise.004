# Exercise 004 - Run a local built container on OpenShift

1) Create a new project named my-second-project;

2) Create a simple Dockerfile that prints the date every 5 seconds
   indefinitely. You can rely on [1];

3) Make yourself able to interact with the OpenShift docker registry;

4) Build this container and tag it "my-second-project/print-date";

5) Tag this container so it can be pushed into the OpenShift registry and try
   to push it;

6) Why it failed?

7) Login into the OpenShift docker registry;

8) Try again to push the container;

9) Create a new app based on this container;

10) Check it works and that the pod produces the message we expect;
