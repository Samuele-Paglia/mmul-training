# Exercise 001 - Run modes - Solutions

1) docker pull hello-world

2) docker pull nginx

3) docker run --rm hello-world

4) docker run --rm nginx

5) To exit from the nginx one you need to Ctrl+C or stop the container from 
   another terminal

6) docker run --rm --detach hello-world

7) docker run --rm --detach nginx

8) Running docker ps will show *just* the nginx container, because the first
   one even if it was launched with --detach is meant just for a one time
   execution (showing the message you see while running ine foreground):

> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
