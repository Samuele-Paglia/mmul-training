# Exercise 006 - Scale-up, scale-down and configure autoscale

1) As user "developer" create a project named "scale-test" and deploy an
   application named "scale-docker-app", using the container build named 
   "ncat-msg-http-port" available on https://github.com/mmul-it/docker;

2) Scale up to 3 replicas. See the DeploymentConfig status change over time;

3) Check the pod list;

4) Scale down to 1 replica. Watch the pods to see status changes;

5) Set an autoscale rule on the DeploymentConfig which schedule up to 3 Pods
   when usage pass 50%. Show how DeploymentConfig description change with
   autoscale enabled;
   NOTE: in Minishift this is the only verification you can do, because of the
         inner limits of the project. Check [1] to try install metrics in
         Minishift.
