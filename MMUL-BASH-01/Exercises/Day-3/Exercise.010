# Exercise 010 - Using case with different types

1) Create a script which ask for a parameter (and print an error if there
   are not one)

2) The script must print some sort of help if launched without parameters

3) The script must save the parameter in a PARAM variable and check
   - If it's a specific number (10 or 20, with different behaviour)
   - If it's a string (student or worker, with the same name)
   - Otherwise print the variable
