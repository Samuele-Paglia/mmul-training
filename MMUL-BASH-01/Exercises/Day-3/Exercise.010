# Exercise 010 - Using case with different types

1) Log into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Create a script which asks for a parameter (and print an error if there
   are not);

3) The script must print some sort of help if launched without parameters;

4) The script must save the parameter in a PARAM variable and check:
   - If it's a specific number (10 or 20, with different behaviour);
   - If it's a string (student or worker, with the same name);
   - Otherwise print the variable;
