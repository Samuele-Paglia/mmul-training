# Exercise 009 - If conditionals

1) Create a script which ask for two parameters (and print an error if there
   are more or less than two)

2) The script must print some sort of help if launched without parameters

3) Then, the two parameters must be saved in two variables.

4) With some if statements tell some information to the user about the
   passed parameters.
   - It's a file?
   - If yes, it's readable? it's writable? it's executable?
   - Otherwise, it's a number?
   - If yes, it's greater than zero? it's lower or equal to zero?
   - Otherwise, its a string. Tell the user and print it
