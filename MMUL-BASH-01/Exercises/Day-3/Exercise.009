# Exercise 009 - If conditionals

1) Log into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Create a script which ask for two parameters (and print an error if there
   are more or less than two);

3) The script must print some sort of help if launched without parameters;

4) Then, the two parameters must be saved in two variables;

5) With some if statements tell some information to the user about the
   passed parameters:
   - Is it a file?
   - If yes, is it readable? Writable? Executable?
   - Otherwise, is it a number?
   - If yes, is it greater than zero? Is it lower or equal to zero?
   - Otherwise, it's a string. Tell the user and print it;
