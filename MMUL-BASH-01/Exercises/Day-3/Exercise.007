# Exercise.007 - Reusable scripts with positional parameters

1) Log into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Write 'parameters.sh' to print:
  - The number of parameters;
  - All the parameters as a string;

3) Write 'second.sh' to print just the second parameter three times;

4) Write 'between.sh' to use first two arguments as min and max for random
   number generation. Look at Day3/Excersise-006: 'random.sh';

5) Write 'grep_passwd.sh', that search argument 1 into /etc/passwd and print
   only the exit code.  A 0 means found, a 1 means not found.
   In the script, redirect the standard output of grep to /dev/null;
