1) Login into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Touch a file called "default_answer.sh", change the mode in order to make
   it executable and add a bash interpreter line;

3) Add a variable in the script and name it "ANSWER". Give it the value of the
   first positional parameter ($1);

4) In the script, add a new line that must be print as its output as following:
   "The answer to life, the universe and everything is 42"
   The value "42" must be written as a default value if no positional parameter
   are passed during script execution;

   again without passing a parameter, check the difference in the output. Do not
   delete the script, as it will be used for the next exercise.
