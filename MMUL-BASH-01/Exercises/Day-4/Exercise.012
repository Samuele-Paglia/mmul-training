Exercise 012 - Print what you get before exit

1) Log into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Create a new script named trap.sh and paste this content:

   ### CONTENT ###
   #!/bin/bash
  
   function trapping {
     echo "Trap is working! Terminating PID $$" 
     echo "Now exiting. BYE!" && exit
   }
   
   trap trapping SIGINT SIGTERM
   echo "Hello! I'm running with PID $$"
   echo "Please send me a SIGNAL to test the trap"

   while :
   do
     sleep 10
   done
   ### END CONTENT ###
   
   
   What trap are you setting up?
   How can you trigger it?
