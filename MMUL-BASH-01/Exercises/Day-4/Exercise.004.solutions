# Exercise 004 - Cycle through all files in a dir and print details - Solutions

1) Supposing your user is "mmul" and your machine is "machine":

> ssh mmul@machine

2) The script should be something like this:

#/bin/bash
for f in /etc/h*
do
    echo "$f"
    ls -l "$f"
done

Note the use of 'in /etc/h*' for item list, that uses the glob expansion.
