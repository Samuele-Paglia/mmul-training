# Exercise 009 - Writing your first function

1) Create a new script named multi_renamer.sh and edit it with your preferred
   editor

2) Declare a function which require two parameters: an old file name and a new
   file name. Check if you have that.

3) The function must rename the file passed as first parameter using the second
   parameter as new name. Save the parameters and:
   
   - Check if the first one points to an existing file
   - Check if the second one points to a non existing one
   - Using the command mv, rename the file

   The function will not t print any output, and return different statuses based
   on what's gone wrong. Return 0 if everything is ok.

4) The script must read 4 parameters, in this sequence:
   - file1 old name
   - file1 new name
   - file2 old name
   - file2 new name

5) Check if you have those parameters, otherwise print a simple help message

6) Once obtain the parameters, call the function two times in order to rename
   files as expected.

7) You must print some output for every function call, so check for the function
   exit code and print something usefull to the user.
