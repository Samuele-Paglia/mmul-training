# Exercise 009 - Writing your first function

1) Log into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Create a new script named multi_renamer.sh and edit it with your preferred
   editor;

3) Declare a function which require two parameters: an old file name and a new
   file name. Check if you have that;

4) The function must rename the file passed as first parameter using the second
   parameter as new name. Save the parameters and:
   
   - Check if the first one points to an existing file
   - Check if the second one points to a non existing one
   - Using the command mv, rename the file

   The function will not t print any output, and return different statuses based
   on what's gone wrong. Return 0 if everything is ok;

5) The script must read 4 parameters, in this sequence:
   - file1 old name
   - file1 new name
   - file2 old name
   - file2 new name

6) Check if you have those parameters, otherwise print a simple help message;

7) Once obtain the parameters, call the function two times in order to rename
   files as expected;

8) You must print some output for every function call, so check for the function
   exit code and print something usefull to the user;
