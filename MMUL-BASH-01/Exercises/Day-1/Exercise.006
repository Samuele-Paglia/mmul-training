# Exercise 006 - Using awk

1) Log into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Create a dummy directory named 'logs' in your home;

3) Use this oneliner to generate 100 files in that, compressing some randomly:

[mmul@machine ~]$ for I in $(seq 1 100); do \
> FILENAME="application-$(printf '%03d' $I).log"; \
> touch $FILENAME; \
> [ ${RANDOM: -1} -eq ${I: -1} ] && gzip $FILENAME; \
> done

4) Look for all the files you created;

5) Using awk, print permissions and file names of each compressed file;

6) Using awk, print the commands to add read permission for other only on the
   compressed files. The output must be ready to copy&paste it in order to
   execute the commands;

7) Using awk, print the commands to compress the uncompressed files numbered
   between 010 and 059. The output must be ready to copy&paste it in order to
   execute the commands;

8) Using awk, print group names relative user list between bracket for each
   group with at least one user (you can found groups in the /etc/group file);
