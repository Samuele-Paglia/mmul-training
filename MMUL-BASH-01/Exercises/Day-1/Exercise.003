# Exercise 003 - Redirections

1) Log into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) print the string "# Exercise 003 - Redirect STDOUT" to a file called 
"output_data" in your HOMEDIR;

3) append string "This is a simple output redirection." to the same file.
Make sure that both strings are there;

4) list the content of the /usr/bin directory and append the result to
the same file;

5) print the content of the $HOME/output_data file and pipe it to the
"less" command (use "q" to exit from less output);

6) list the content of /root directory and print the STDOUT to the shell
and, eventually, STDERR to the file listing_log in your HOMEDIR.
Check if any error has occurred;

7) If any error has been logged, list the content of /tmp directory and
redirect both STDOUT and STDERR to the file listing_log in your HOMEDIR,
appending data;

8) Usign STDIN redirection, address the content of the listing_log file
in your HOMEDIR inside the "cat" command;
