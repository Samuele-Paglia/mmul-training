# Attach a PVC object to a DC, then create a new one updating a DC

1) Ensure you have the PV and the PVC already created (in previously exercise)

2) Ensure you have an app running (check for a DeploymentConfig, i.e. the nginx one
   previously created in Day 4)

3) Edit the DeploymentConfig

4) Add the volumeMounts: attribute in spec:template:spec:containers: pointing to a Pod
   volume named 'data'. Also add a volumes: attribute in spec:template:spec: which
   define a volume named 'data' which point to the previously created PVC

5) Show if the updated DeploymentConfig deploy a new pod

6) Get the new pod name and explore its attributes

7) Open a shell inside the pod and try to work in the /data path

8) Remove the volumeMounts: and the volumes: attributes from the DeploymentConfig

9) Ensure a new pod will be scheduled, get the new name, open a shell inside it and
   try to access the /data path

10) Try adding a new PersistentVolumeClaim to the deployment using the CLI command oc
    set volume --add mounting in a /newdata path

11) Get the new deployed pod name, show it details and try accessing the /newdata path
    inside it

12) Check the new PersistentVolumeClaim and it details
