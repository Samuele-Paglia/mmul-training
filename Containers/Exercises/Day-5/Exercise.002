# Exercise 001 - Attach a PVC object to a DC, then create a new one updating a DC

1) Ensure you have the PV and the PVC already created (in previous exercise);

2) Create a new project named "pvc-test" and an application named "tomcat";

3) Edit the DeploymentConfig adding the "volumeMounts:" attribute in
   spec:template:spec:containers: pointing to a Pod volume named "data".
   Also add a "volumes:" attribute in spec:template:spec: which define a volume
   named "data" which point to the previously created PVC;

5) Show if the updated DeploymentConfig deploy a new pod;

6) Get the new pod attributes;

7) Open a shell inside the pod and try to work in the /data path;

8) Keeping the shell open, from another console on the exporting host add other
   files to the share and see you are able to access them from the pod;
