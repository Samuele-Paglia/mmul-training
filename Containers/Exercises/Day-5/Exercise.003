# Exercise 003 - Deploy some applications from git and from Docker images

1) Look at current minishift status

2) Trying deploy a new app from a container image on docker hub (i.e. tomee), then follow the DeploymentConfig
   logs to ensure the app will deploy correctly

3) Try to expose the service and reach the app from a browser

4) Remove the deployed app (you can use oc delete all and selectors)

5) Deploy a new app from a Git repository with a Dockerfile in it (i.e. https://github.com/mmul-it/docker,
   path ncat-msg-http-port/).
   Ensure the DeploymentConfig was created and see what happen in the BuildConfig object

6) Try exposing this new app and reach that with a browser

7) Remove the deployed app

8) Deploy a new app from a Git repository with source code in it (i.e. https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world)
   Ensure the DeploymentConfig was created and follow what's happening in the BuildConfig object

9) Try exposing this new app and reach that with a browser
