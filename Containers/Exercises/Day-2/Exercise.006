# Exercise 006 - Create an image from a running container

1) Run a container named "nginx" using the "nginx:latest" image;

2) Log into the container;

3) Change the contents of the default file exposed by the nginx instance to be
   "My new shiny Nginx container image", you can find out where the default
   file is stored by looking into the /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf config
   file;

4) Exit the container console and generate an image starting from this running
   instance, called "my-new-shiny-nginx";

5) Stop the original container;

6) Create a new container starting from the newly created image, and check that
   the modifications made are available;
