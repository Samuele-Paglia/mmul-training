# Exercise 007 - 

1) Pull from www.mmul.it, at port 5000, the broken-nginx image. Authenticate
   yourself with user "dockertraining" and password "l3tstr41n";

2) Try to run the image the usual way, naming the container "broken-nginx" and
   publishing the port at 8080 localhost port;

3) Check if the container is running (it should not);

4) Try to find out what's wrong with this image;

5) Would you be able to fix the problem on this image and make it usable?

BONUS) There's another problem with this container, check the Nginx page. Would
       you be able to fix also this?
