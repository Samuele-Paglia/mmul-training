# Exercise 005 - Exposing your application

1) As developer, deploy again your mysql application into the project
   "expose-test", this time without removing the Service part and in addition
   to that deploy the tomcat application;

2) Verify if the DeploymentConfig, Pods and Service are up and running;

3) Expose both application and verify that just tomcat is reachable, then
   remove the route related to mysql;

   outside the OpenShift Cluster;

5) Delete the mysql service;

6) Create a new NodePort service for mysql, mapping port 30000;

7) Verify the status and the service object;
